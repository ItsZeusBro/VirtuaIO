# VirtuaIO
## Virtua IO or Virtual IO is a requirement of the File Interaction Model. It is a mitigation strategy for File Interactions.

Basically, when you are running File Interaction scripts that are hard to reason about, you have the option of running mitigation techniques that start from the place of execution that led to failure in the Interaction Script.

Virtualizing the files you are working on, enables you to mitigate essentially without data loss. Mitigating time is also a consideration, but the mitigation script can run in parallel if it needs to be handed off in the event of an error.
